# Customer-Churn-Classification
Implementation of machine learning classification algorithms on the Customer Churn dataset to compare the  performances of various algorithms.

Utilized machine learning classification algorithms on the Customer Churn dataset to compare the 
performances of various algorithms. Carried out comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to 
uncover underlying patterns and relationships.

Once the optimal algorithm was identified, executed hyperparameter tuning to determine the most 
effective hyperparameters for the model.
